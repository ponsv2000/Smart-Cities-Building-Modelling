The study made during these three sessions consists in the estimation of the energy efficiency of a smart home by modeling and simulation.\n",

    "# **Conclusion**\n",
    "\n",
    "It is crucial to analyse the heat flow in a building to be able to enable energy management and optimise the energy consumption of the building. By creating a model of a building and considering heat flows in the form of conduction, convection and radiation in both steady state and dynamic conditions, this can be accomplished. In this project, we were able to develop a coherent thermal model of a building and verify the relevance of our modelling choices through simulations. The obtained results are consistent for both the static and the dynamic model, but it can be seen that the obtained time step of about 30 seconds regarding the dynamic model, is relatively small. This implies that the simulation possibly could be improved. \n",
    "\n",
    "Further, a controller was implemented which modelised a HVAC model capable of heating and cooling. Regarding this, it could be seen that the time step depends on Kp affecting the performance of the controller. When Kp goes towards the infinity, the controller becomes more idealised and when the value of Kp goes towards zero, the controller becomes less efficient. \n",
